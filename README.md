cipherWork
==========

For the CTF noobs in the cyber club and elsewhere.

Currently, it supports blind decryption of ROT13, focused Base64, and analyzes for hashes. Currently only SHA1 is supported, but MD5 and other hashes are going to be. I also hope to add Caesar ciphers but I want this code to be original so I'm not trying to just copy+paste from stack overflow and call it a day.

This is meant to be a sample project to prove I'm at least functional in Javascript, and if I decide to make it pretty, HTML.
